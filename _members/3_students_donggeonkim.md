    &nbsp;My interests are simulation of reactions occurring inside lithium-ion batteries, building 'transferable Machine Learning(ML) potential' that can be applied in various ways using machine learning, Multi-task machine learning using 'SGPR'(Sparse Gaussian Process Regression) which developed from Gaussian process, calculation of theoretical redox potential for several molecules in an aqueous environment.<br>

    &nbsp;I'm DongGeon Kim, in the master's course. Recently, the importance of carbon neutrality has emerged worldwide. Accordingly, the share of eco-friendly energy is increasing. With this trend, the demand for batteries, which are the main power source for electric vehicles, potable mobility, gadgets, etc... is increasing.<br>
    &nbsp;There are various types of rechargeable batteries(Lead_Acid, Ni-Cd, Ni-MH, Lithium-ion, Li-polymer, etc ...). But Lithium-ion batteries with good efficiency are mostly used nowadays. However, there are still critical problems with the stability of Lithium-ion batteries, the main cause of which is explosion due to evaporation and ignition of liquid electrolyte. Since there is still a lack of theoretical understanding of the correlation between lithium ions and liquid electrolytes, this problem took my interest.<br>
    <br>
    
    &nbsp;What I'm doing recently is theoretical multi-task Machine Learning and SGPR studying. And binding energy and Lewis acidity calculations of the UIO-66 + TFSI model used for composite solid electrolytes are in progress.<br>
    <br>
    
    &nbsp;In the laboratory, I'm in charge of managing the homepage(in progress...) and recording information on the wiki(to be added).<br>
