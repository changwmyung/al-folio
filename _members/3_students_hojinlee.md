    &nbsp;I am Hojin Lee, a master's student in Computational Chemistry. My research interests lie in contributing to various environmental issues, such as greenhouse gas emissions, by creating high-efficiency catalysts.<br>
    <br>
    
    &nbsp;Specifically, I aim to design catalysts by connecting transition metal dimers to nitrogen-doped defected graphene. This process is carried out at the first-principles level using a combination of DFT and machine learning.<br>
    <br>
    
    &nbsp;After completing the calculations for all target transition metals, I will analyze the results to determine the necessary factors for electrochemical catalyst calculations (HER, OER, ORR, etc.) and conduct research on electrochemical reactions.<br>
    <br>
    
    &nbsp;In the laboratory, I'm in charge of training new students and producing training materials(ex. VASP).<br>
    
    If you are curious or interested in our lab, Please feel free to contact me by e-mail. :)
