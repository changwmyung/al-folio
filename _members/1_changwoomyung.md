I develop and apply the state-of-the-art computational methods to understand essential problems in chemistry, physics, and materials science with a particular emphasis on problems in surface chemistry. I provided important insights for emergent energy materials such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes and catalysis using the high-level quantum mechanical simulations. Theoretical understanding of such energy materials is of great importance for the design and development of efficient energy sources to mitigate climate change and to achieve a green economy.

I’m Chang Woo Myung, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry at Chungnam National University. Before joining the faculty, I worked as a postdoc researcher at University of Cambridge with Prof. Angelos Michaelides and at ETH Zurich/USI with Prof. Michele Parrinello. I received my PhD in Chemistry under Prof. Kwang S. Kim at UNIST, Korea. Before that, I recieved my MS and BS at POSTECH, Korea.
